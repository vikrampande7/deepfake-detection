"deepfake-detection" with Explainable AI
- Course Project for ECE 792 - Advanced Machine Learning

This repo contains the code, results, models for Deep Fake detection with XAI.

- To classify real and fake images, pretrained XceptionNet model is implemented.
- For model interpretability, algorithms such as LIME and Grad-CAM are implemented.
